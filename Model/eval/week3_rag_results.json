      "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. This process mainly takes place in the leaves of the plants, which are known as the \"food factories.\" During photosynthesis, plants use chlorophyll (a green pigment) to capture sunlight. The word equation for photosynthesis is:\n\n**Sunlight + Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen**\n\nIn this process, glucose is produced as food, which can be used immediately for energy or stored as starch for later use. Additionally, oxygen is released into the air as a byproduct.\n\nKey points about photosynthesis:\n- It requires sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and chlorophyll.\n- The primary site for photosynthesis is the leaves.\n- Other green parts of the plant that contain chlorophyll can also perform photosynthesis.\n\n**Sources: [Source 1], [Source 2], [Source 3]**\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. What are the raw materials needed for photosynthesis?\n2. What happens to the glucose produced during photosynthesis?\n3. How do plants take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis?",

Air bubbles 10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a nutshell We know that water, sunlight, carbon dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis that produces carbohydrates (Fig. 10.5). During photosynthesis, food is actually produced in the form of glucose, a simple carbohydrate. This glucose not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage. The word equation of photosynthesis is given below Sunlight Carbon dioxide + Water Glucose + Oxygen Chlorophyll KNOW A SCIENTIST Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896-1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 1921-1935. He studied eff ects of the amount of water and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the importance of water, temperature, and the colour of light in the process of photosynthesis. 10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during photosynthesis?",

Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch? Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis. Do other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform photosynthesis. So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis. But have you ever thought about what more happens during this process? Do plants only take in substances from their surroundings, or do they also release something?

          "text": "Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge. It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size and develop over time. The journey of life of a human can be divided into different stages-infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another.",

Let us explore how plants obtain nutrients for their growth. 10.1 How Do Plants Grow? Look around your neighbourhood. Have you observed any changes in a plant during its life span? As a plant grows, new leaves and branches emerge, its height increases, and its stem thickens. What do you think causes these changes? Discuss with your friends and provide your explanation as well.

      "answer": "Friction is a force that occurs when two surfaces come into contact with each other. It opposes the motion of an object. For example, when you push a box across a table, the box eventually stops because of the friction between the box and the table. This force acts in the opposite direction to the movement of the object, which is why it slows down and stops.\n\nFriction arises due to the irregularities present on the surfaces in contact. Even surfaces that seem smooth have tiny bumps and grooves that can lock into each other, making it harder for one surface to slide over the other. This is why the type of surface can affect how much friction there is; for instance, a box will slide further on a smooth surface than on a rough one.\n\n**Sources: [Source 4]**\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. What happens to an object when it is pushed on a rough surface compared to a smooth surface?\n2. Can you give an example of a situation where friction is helpful?\n3. Why does a ball rolling on the ground eventually stop?",

This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing human population globally. Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties.

In the mid-20th century, the use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides helped increase food production. This period is known as the Green Revolution. However, these farming methods are now considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices harm both the environment and human health? Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil degradation.

Similarly, a forest where trees grow close to each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if the trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less dense.

Density is defined as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance. The density of a substance may be expressed mathematically using the formula: Density = Mass Volume The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size.

Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size) are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier. Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have TRIANGLES MATHEMATICS been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3 and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).",

When it is multiplied 3 or 5 times the product is negative. Can you generalise these statements further? Using this understanding of multiplication of many integers, can you give a simple rule to find the sign of the product of many integers? Now, consider the expression 5 × (4 + (- 2)). As in the case of positive integers, is this expression equal to 5 × 4 + 5 × (- 2)? We see that it does. Recall that we call this property the distributive property.",

          "text": "The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we learned in an earlier grade. By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., aset of numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and analysis. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing and computing with numbers in the way that we do today. The discovery of 0 and the resulting Indian number system is truly one of the greatest, most creative, and most influential inventions of all time - appearing constantly in our daily lives and forming the basis of much of modern science, technology, computing, accounting, surveying, and more.",

The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and South America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in a language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century. In Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic events that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian Revolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of economic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants.",

One simple factor common to all democracies is: the government is chosen by the people. We could thus start with a simple definition: democracy is a form of government in which the rulers are elected by the people. This is a useful starting point. This definition allows us to separate democracy from forms of government that are clearly not democratic. The army rulers of Myanmar were not elected by the people. Those who happened to be in control of the army became the rulers of the country. People had no say in this decision. Dictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not elected by the people. This also applies to monarchies. The kings of Saudi Arabia rule not because the people have chosen them to do so but because they happen to be born into the royal family.

Step by step, we work out the meaning of the terms involved in this definition. The aim here is to understand clearly the bare minimum features of a democratic form of government. After going through this chapter we should be able to distinguish a democratic form of government from anon-democratic government. Towards the end of this chapter, we step beyond this minimal objective and introduce a broader idea of democracy. Democracy is the most prevalent form of government in the world today and it is expanding to more countries. But why is it so? What makes it better than other forms of government? That is the second big question that we take up in this chapter. CHAPTER 1 What is Democracy? Why Democracy? DEMOCRATIC POLITICS I have heard a different version.

Every democracy has to try to realise the ideals of a democratic decisionmaking. This cannot be achieved once and for all. This requires a constant effort to save and strengthen democratic forms of decision-making. What we do as citizens can make a difference to making our country more or less democratic. This is the strength and the weakness of democracy: the fate of the country depends not just on what the rulers do, but mainly on what we, as citizens, do. This is what distinguished democracy from other governments. Other forms of government like monarchy, dictatorship or one-party rule do not require all citizens to take part in politics. In fact most non-democratic governments would like citizens not to take part in politics.",

But once the principle is recognised, it becomes easier for women to wage a struggle against what is now unacceptable legally and morally. In anon-democratic set up, this unacceptability would not have legal basis because the principle of individual freedom and dignity would not have the legal and moral force there. The same is true of caste inequalities. Democracy in India has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and equal opportunity. There are instances still of caste-based inequalities and atrocities, but these lack the moral and legal foundations. Perhaps, it is the recognition that makes ordinary citizens value their democratic rights. Expectations from democracy also function as the criteria for judging any democratic country.

      "answer": "The central idea of the poem \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost revolves around choices and their consequences. The poem describes a traveler who comes to a fork in the woods and must decide which path to take. This decision symbolizes the choices we face in life. The traveler reflects on how each road represents different directions in life, and the choice he makes will shape his future. The poem emphasizes that choices can be significant and that we often wonder about the paths we did not take.\n\nKey phrases in the poem, such as \"diverged\" and \"wanted wear,\" highlight the idea of separation and the uniqueness of each choice. The traveler acknowledges that he cannot travel both paths, which reflects the reality that we must make decisions that can lead to different outcomes.\n\n**Sources: [Source 1]**\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1. What does the phrase \"a yellow wood\" symbolize in the poem?\n2. How does the traveler feel about the road he did not take?\n3. Why is the choice of road significant in the context of the poem?",

He has faith that God will help him, so he writes a letter to God asking for a hundred pesos to support his family and replant his crops after a hailstorm destroys them. Lencho believes that God will answer his prayers.\n\nWhen Lencho goes to the post office to check for the money, the postmaster and the postman find his faith amusing but are also surprised by it. They decide to help Lencho by collecting money among themselves, but they only manage to gather seventy pesos. Lencho, however, is convinced that the full amount was sent and thinks that thirty pesos have been stolen. He writes another letter to God, asking Him to send the missing amount directly and expressing his disappointment in the post office officials.\n\nThis story highlights themes of faith, hope, and the human spirit's resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n**Sources: [Source 1], [Source 3]**\n\n**Follow-up Questions:**\n1.

स्‍ववर आए तो 'इ' को य्, उ को व्, ऋ, को 'र्' तथाा 'लृ' को 'ल्' आदेश हो जााताा है। उदााहरणयदि + अपि यद्यपि इति + आदि इत्‍यादि अति + आचाार: अत्‍याचाार: इति + अवदत् इत्‍यवदत् नदी + आवेग: नद्यावेग: सखी +

अयािदचतुष्‍टय के नााम से जाानाा जााताा है। उदााहरणने + अनम् नयनम् शे + अनम् शयनम् नै + अक: नायक: भो + अनम् भवनम् भाानो + ए भाानवे पौ + अक: पाावक: नौ + इक: नाविक: भौ + उक: भाावुक: vi) पूर्वरूप सन्‍धि (एङ: पदान्‍ताादति)- पूर्वरूप सन्‍धि को अयादि सन्‍धि काा अपवााद कहाा जाा सकताा है। पद के अन्‍त्‍त में स्थित ए, ओ के बााद यदि ह्रस्‍वव 'अ' आए तो 'ए+अ' दोनों के स्‍थाान पर पूर्वरूप सन्धि 'ए' एकाादेश तथाा 'ओ+अ' दोनों के स्‍थाान पर 'ओ' एकाादेश हो जााताा है। अर्थात् ए-ओ के पश्‍चाात् आने वाालाा 'अ' अपनाा रूप ए-ओ में ही (िवलीन कर) छुपाा देताा है। उस विलीन 'अ' काा रूप लिपि में अवग्रह चिह्न (ऽ) द्वााराा अंकित कियाया जााताा है, जैसे- हरे + अत्र में हरयत्र होनाा चािहए थाा परन्‍तु्‍तु 'अ' व्‍याकरणवीथि: 'ए' में समाा गयाया और रूप बनाा हरेऽत्र। यहााँ उच्‍चाारण के समय 'हरेत्र' ही कहाा जााताा है (अवग्रह काा

'प्‍लुतप्रगृह्या अचि नित्‍ययम्'- प्रकृतिभााव काा अर्थ है सन्‍धि करने काा निषेध करनाा, अर्थात् प्रकृत वर्णों में विकृति (परिवर्तन) न करके उन्‍ह्‍हें ज्‍यों काा त्‍यों बनााए रखनाा। वस्‍तुतुत: इसे सन्‍धि काा भेद न कहकर सन्‍धि काा अभााव ही कहनाा चाहिए क्‍योंकि सन्‍धि नियम के लाागू होने की स्‍थिति में भी सन्‍धि कार्य नहीं होताा। यदि कोई वर्ण प्‍लुलुत याया प्रगृह्य संज्ञक होताा है और उसके बााद अच् आताा है तो प्‍लुलुत एवं प्रगृह्य वर्णों काा सन्धि न होते हुए प्रकृति भााव होताा है। प्रगृह्य संज्ञा ा (क) ईदूदेद्विवचनं प्रगृह्यम्, (ख) अदसो माात् (क) ईदन्‍त्‍त, ऊदन्‍त्‍त तथाा एदन्‍त्‍त द्विवचन रूपों की प्रगृह्य संज्ञाा होती है। अर्थात् ऐसे द्विवचन, जिनके अन्‍त्‍त में ई, ऊ अथवाा ए होताा है, उनकी प्रगृह्यसंज्ञाा होती है तथाा जिनकी प्रगृह्य संज्ञाा होती हैं, उनके बााद अच् होने पर किसी भी प्रकाार की सन्‍धि नहीं होती। यथाा- कवी + इच्‍छछत:, विष्‍णूणू + इमौ, बालिके + आगच्‍छछत:, यहााँ पर कवी, विष्‍णूणू, तथाा बालिके ये क्रमश: ईकाारान्‍त्‍त, ऊकाारान्‍त्‍त तथाा एकाारान्‍त्‍त द्विवचन के रूप होने के काारण प्रगृह्य संज्ञक हैं, अत: यहााँ किसी प्रकाार की सन्‍धि नहीं होती, इसलिए ये कवी इच्‍छछत:, विष्‍णूणू इमौ, बालिके आगच्‍छछत: ही रहेंगे, न कि कवीच्‍छछत: इत्‍यादि। (ख) अदस् शब्‍दद के 'म्' के बााद 'ई' याया 'ऊ' आए तो वहााँ पर भी प्रगृह्य संज्ञाा होती है। यथाा- अमी + ईशाा:, अमू + आसााते। यहााँ पर 'अमी' तथाा 'अमू' प्रगृह्य संज्ञक हैं, अत: किसी भी प्रकाार की सन्‍धि नहीं होगी। • प्‍लुलुत वर्ण में प्रकृतिभााव काा उदााहरण है, एहि कृष्‍णण३ अत्र गौश्‍चचरति। यहााँ पर अ+अ में दीर्घ सन्धि नहीं हुई, क्‍योंकि सम्बोधन पद 'कृष्ण' में 'अ' प्‍लुलुत है। viii) पररूप सन्‍धि (एङि पररूपम्)- उपसर्ग के 'अ' के पश्‍चाात् यदि 'ए' या या 'ओ' आए तो उनकाा पररूप एकाादेश हो जााताा है। इस पररूप सन्‍धि को वृद्धि सन्‍धि काा अपवााद कहाा जाा सकताा है। पररूप कार्य से ताात्‍पर्य है कि जब पूर्वपद काा अन्‍तिम वर्ण अगले शब्‍दद के आदि वर्ण के समाान होकर उसमें मिल जााए, जैसे- प्र + एजते = प्रेजते में वृद्धि कार्य प्रैजते होनाा चाहिए थाा, लेकिन 'प्र' में स्‍थित 'अ' की स्‍थिति 'ए' में ही मिल गई अर्थात् अ+ए इन दोनों के स्‍थाान पर 'ए' एकाादेश हो गयाया है। यहााँ पर 'अ' की अपनी सत्ताा ही नहीं बची। अत: प्र + एजते = प्रेजते, उप + ओषति = उपोषति हुआ। व्‍याकरणवीथि: अभ्‍यासकार्यम् प्र.",

      "answer": "1. **Explanation of GDP:**\n   GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries in a specific year. It represents the economic performance of a country. GDP can be understood in different ways, such as through the value added by firms, the total expenditure on final goods and services, or the total income generated from production.\n\n   There are three main methods to calculate GDP:\n   - **Production Method:** This calculates GDP by summing the value added at each stage of production.\n   - **Expenditure Method:** This method looks at the total spending on goods and services for final use.\n   - **Income Method:** This method sums up all incomes earned by factors of production, including wages and profits.\n\n   It's important to note that while a higher GDP might suggest a stronger economy, it does not necessarily mean that the well-being of all citizens has improved, as income distribution can be uneven.\n\n2. **Key Ideas:**\n   - **Definition of GDP:** The sum total of value of goods and services created within a country in a particular year.\n   - **Calculation Methods:**\n     - **Production Method:** GDP = Sum of Gross Value Added (GVA) of all firms.\n     - **Expenditure Method:** GDP = Total expenditure on final goods and services.\n     - **Income Method:** GDP = Sum of all factor incomes (wages, profits, etc.).\n\n3. **Sources:** [Source 1], [Source 2], [Source 4]\n\n4. **Follow-up Questions:**\n   - What are the three methods to calculate GDP, and how do they differ from each other?\n   - Why might a rising GDP not indicate an increase in the welfare of all citizens?\n   - Explain the concept of Gross Value Added (GVA) in relation to GDP.",

          "text": "GDP is the sum total of value of goods and services created within the geographical boundary of a country in a particular year. It gets distributed among the people as incomes (except for retained earnings). So we may be tempted to treat higher level of GDP of a country as an index of greater well-being of the people of that country (to account for price changes, we may take the value of real GDP instead of nominal GDP). But there are at least three reasons why this may not be correct. 1. Distribution of GDP - how uniform is it: If the GDP of the country is rising, the welfare may not rise as a consequence. This is because the rise in GDP may be concentrated in the hands of very few individuals or firms. For the rest, the income may in fact have fallen. In such a case the welfare of the entire country cannot be said to have increased. For example, suppose in year 2000, an imaginary country had 100 individuals each earning Rs 10. Therefore the GDP of the country was Rs 1,000 (by income method).",

          "text": "Net value added of the firm i ≡ GVAi - Depreciation of the firm i (Di) If we sum the gross value added of all the firms of the economy in a year, we get a measure of the value of aggregate amount of goods and services produced by the economy in a year (just as we had done in the wheat-bread example). Such an estimate is called Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Thus GDP ≡ Sum total of gross value added of all the firms in the economy.

Since, the identities (2.2), (2.4) and (2.6) are different expressions of the same variable, namely GDP, we may represent the equivalence by Fig. 2.2. Now, let us look at a numerical example to see how all the three methods of estimating GDP give us the same answer. Example: There are two firms, Aand B. Suppose A uses no raw material and produces cotton worth Rs. 50. A sells its cotton to firm B, who uses it to produce cloth. B sells the cloth produced to consumers for Rs. 200. 1.

These decisions, in turn, depend on many factors such as income and credit availability. In any period, the level of demand may not be sufficient for full utilisation of labour and other resources of the economy. Since wages and prices do not fall below a level, employment cannot be brought back to the earlier level automatically. The government needs to intervene to raise the aggregate demand. On the other hand, there may be times when demand exceeds available output under conditions of high employment and thus may give rise to inflation. In such situations, restrictive conditions may be needed to reduce demand.

We will see below why, sometimes, we also depart from this useful simplification when we realise that the country's economy as a whole may best be seen as composed of distinct sectors. For certain purposes the interdependence of (or even rivalry between) two sectors of the economy (agriculture and industry, for example) or the relationships between sectors (like the household sector, the business sector and government in a democratic set-up) help us understand some things happening to the country's economy much better, than by only looking at the economy as a whole.

A ledger is the collection of all the accounts, debited or credited, in the journal proper and various special journal (about which you will learn in chapter 4). A ledger may be in the form of bound register, or cards, or separate sheets may be maintained in a loose leaf binder. In the ledger, each account is opened preferably on separate page or card. Utility A ledger is very useful and is of utmost importance in the organisation. The net result of all transactions in respect of a particular account on a given date can be ascertained only from the ledger. For example, the management on a particular date wants to know the amount due from a certain customer or the amount the firm has to pay to a particular supplier, such information can be found only in the ledger. Such information is very difficult to ascertain from the journal because the transactions are recorded in the chronological order and defies classification.",

In this chapter, we will discuss the details of each step involved in the accounting process. The first step involves identifying the transactions to be recorded and preparing the source documents which are in turn recorded in the basic book of original entry called journal and are then posted to individual accounts in the principal book called ledger.",

The_______________concept requires that accounting transaction should be free from the bias of accountants and others. 2.3 Systems of Accounting The systems of recording transactions in the book of accounts are generally classified into two types, viz. Double entry system and Single entry system. Double entry system is based on the principle of \"Dual Aspect\" which states that every transaction has two effects, viz. receiving of a benefit and giving of a benefit. Each transaction, therefore, involves two or more accounts and is recorded at different places in the ledger. The basic principle followed is that every debit must have a corresponding credit. Thus, one account is debited and the other is credited. Double entry system is a complete system as both the aspects of a transaction are recorded in the book of accounts. The system is accurate and more reliable as the possibilities of frauds and mis-appropriations are minimised. The arithmetic inaccuracies in records can mostly be checked by preparing the trial balance. The system of double entry can be implemented by big as well as small organisations.",

It shows that he probably relied on then-current bookkeeping manuals as the basis for his masterpiece. In his book, he used the present day popular terms of accounting Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.). These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor. In explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also stated that a merchants responsibility include to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures. 1.1.1 Economic Events Business organisations involves economic events.",

Debit Credit Amount Amount Dec.24 Purchases A/cDr. 30,000 To Govind Traders A/c 30,000 (Purchase of goods- in-trade from Govind Traders) It will be noticed that although the transaction results in an increase in stock of goods, the account debited is purchases, not goods. In fact, the goods account is divided into five accounts, viz. purchases account, sales account, purchases returns account, sales returns account, and stock account.",

The trial balance is a tool for verifying the correctness of debit and credit amounts. It is an arithmetical check under the double entry system which verifies that both aspects of every transaction have been recorded accurately. This chapter explains the meaning and process of preparation of trial balance and the types of errors and their rectification. 6.1 Meaning of Trial Balance A trial balance is a statement showing the balances, or total of debits and credits, of all the accounts in the ledger with a view to verify the arithmatical accuracy of posting into the ledger accounts.

Why so ? 2.3 ACCELERATION The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. How to describe this change? Should it be described as the rate of change in velocity with distance or with time ? This was a problem even in Galileo's time. It was first thought that this change could be described by the rate of change of velocity with distance. But, through his studies of motion of freely falling objects and motion of objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change of velocity with time is a constant of motion for all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the change in velocity with distance is not constant - it decreases with the increasing distance of fall. This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate of change of velocity with time.",

The pressure exerted by the air around us is known as atmospheric pressure. Differences in air pressure cause winds to blow. Warm air rises, creating alow-pressure area. Cooler air from surrounding higher-pressure regions moves in to take its place. Important requirements for the formation of thunderstorms are moisture and strong winds. Strong winds moving upwards and downwards facilitate rubbing of ice particles with water droplets, causing electric charges to develop in clouds.

Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide (CO2)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere* without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice. Thus, we can say that pressure and temperature determine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or gas. Now, heat slowly and observe. What do you infer from the above activity? A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation and the direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition. 1.4.2 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have already learnt that the difference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles.

What happens when you pour some acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm? The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool. After ahot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface. Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation? Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer? During summer, we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. We know that during evaporation, the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour. The heat energy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good absorber of water helps in absorbing the sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for easy evaporation.",

Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, which provide food and oxygen to animals, including humans. The Sun is responsible for climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, winds-all of which are important for sustaining life on the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system is 'astronomical unit' (au) which is approximately the distance between the Sun and the Earth. The Sun produces heat and light, and is the main source of energy on the Earth (Fig. 12.6). How big is the Sun? It is about 100 times bigger than the Earth in diameter.
